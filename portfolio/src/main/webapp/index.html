          <h3>Who I am</h3>
          <p>My name is Eriyeza Buwembo and I am going into my third year of Computer science at the 
              University of Toronto. I was born in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada and am the youngest of 4
              siblings. My parents were both born in Uganda and I visit there around every other year.</p>

            <h4>Basketball</h4>
            <p>I've played basketball for almost my entire life and was fortunate to be given the 
                opportunity to play in University. Due to injuries, I decided not to continue playing 
                competetively but I still love playing for fun with friends and in Intramurals. I also
                enjoy watching the NBA and my favourite player would have to be Kevin Durant.</p>

            <h4>Anime/Manga</h4>
            <p>I was first introduced to anime in grade 6 with Attack on Titan, but did not start watching
                actively until high school when my friends introduced me to One Piece. I got around 120 episodes 
                in before my other friends started watching Naruto and I decided to watch with them. Naruto and 
                Naruto Shippuden were the first anime that I completed. After completing them, I went back to One 
                Piece and caught up to the latest episode at the time which was around 750. I was extremely eager to 
                continue so I decided to start the manga where the anime left off and that was the beginning of my
                manga reading career. Since then I have watched a lot of different anime and started reading the manga
                of some anime that I really enjoyed. As of May 2020, my favourite anime of all time is Hunter x Hunter 2011.</p>

          <div id="music">
            <h4>Music</h4>
            <p>Being the youngest of 4 siblings, I grew up listening to a combination of the music that my older siblings
                listened to. My sister played the piano and I also played the violin and the viola until I started high school. 
                These things largely shaped my music taste. My favourite genre to listen to is Hip Hop and R&B but I am open to
                listening to almost any music other than country music. I enjoy going to orchestras and the music score of a movie
                largely influences whether I'll like it or love it. My favourite Hip Hop Artists include Kanye West, Drake, 
                Childish Gambino, Travis Scott, Frank Ocean, and many more. Notable film score composers I like are Hans Zimmer,
                Ludwig Goransson, and John Williams.</p>

              <h4>Fivetran</h4>
              <p>I was a Product Analyst Intern at Fivetran from the beginning of June until the end of July in 2019. One of the
                  projects I did there was to create a dashboard that illustrated new user retention across trial steps in a given month. This 
                  gave product designers insight as to where potential clients were having trouble with the trial and steps that may need
                  improving.</p>

              <h4>Manga Tracker</h4>
              <p>As mentioned earlier in my interests, I enjoy reading manga and I used to read them from websites online.
                I found that checking the website to see if there was a new chapter for all of the manga that I was reading
                was very tedious and was often a waste of time if there were no new chapters. Their sites were usually filled
                with lots of ads and popups which made visiting them very unpleasant. There was also pressure to read the 
                chapters as soon as they were released in order to avoid getting spoiled from other sources such as social media 
                or friends. I decided to make a web scraper using python that would find out if there was a new release for the 
                manga that I read and would send an email with the chapters as attachments. I had set this script to run every hour 
                so I now get chapters almost as soon as they are released and the emails contain just the pages with no ads so
                it makes for a pleasurable reading experience.</p>
