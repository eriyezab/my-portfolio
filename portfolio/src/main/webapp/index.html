                    <p>I've played basketball for almost my entire life and was fortunate to be given the 
                    opportunity to play in University. Due to injuries, I decided not to continue playing 
                    competetively but I still love playing for fun with friends and in Intramurals. I also
                    enjoy watching the NBA and my favourite player would have to be Kevin Durant.

                    <h4 class="card-title display-4">Anime & Manga</h4>
                    <p>I was first introduced to anime in grade 6 with Attack on Titan, but did not start watching
                    actively until high school when my friends introduced me to One Piece. I got around 120 episodes 
                    in before my other friends started watching Naruto and I decided to watch with them. Naruto and 
                    Naruto Shippuden were the first anime that I completed. After completing them, I went back to One 
                    Piece and caught up to the latest episode at the time which was around 750. I was extremely eager to 
                    continue so I decided to start the manga where the anime left off and that was the beginning of my
                    manga reading career. Since then I have watched a lot of different anime and started reading the manga
                    of some anime that I really enjoyed. As of May 2020, my favourite anime of all time is Hunter x Hunter 2011.

                    <h4 class="card-title display-4">Music</h4>
                    <p>Being the youngest of 4 siblings, I grew up listening to a combination of the music that my older siblings
                    listened to. My sister played the piano and I also played the violin and the viola until I started high school. 
                    These things largely shaped my music taste. My favourite genre to listen to is Hip Hop and R&B but I am open to
                    listening to almost any music other than country music. I enjoy going to orchestras and the music score of a movie
                    largely influences whether I'll like it or love it. My favourite Hip Hop Artists include Kanye West, Drake, 
                    Childish Gambino, Travis Scott, Frank Ocean, and many more. Notable film score composers I like are Hans Zimmer,
                    Ludwig Goransson, and John Williams.

                      <p class="card-text">As mentioned earlier in my interests, I enjoy reading manga and I used to read them from websites online.
                      I found that checking the website to see if there was a new chapter for all of the manga that I was reading
                      was very tedious and was often a waste of time if there were no new chapters. Their sites were usually filled
                      with lots of ads and popups which made visiting them very unpleasant. There was also pressure to read the 
                      chapters as soon as they were released in order to avoid getting spoiled from other sources such as social media 
                      or friends. I decided to make a web scraper using python that would find out if there was a new release for the 
                      manga that I read and would send an email with the chapters as attachments. I had set this script to run every hour 
                      so I now get chapters almost as soon as they are released and the emails contain just the pages with no ads so
                      it makes for a pleasurable reading experience.</p>
